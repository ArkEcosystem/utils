## Caveats

-   The native `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and `forEach` will generally be faster when used on arrays that contain nothing but numerical values.
-   If you plan to use `formatCurrency` method with node.js for anything else then the `en-US` locale you'll have to make sure to properly setup https://github.com/unicode-org/full-icu-npm as node.js itself only ships with the `en-US` locale by default unless specifically build with more locales.
